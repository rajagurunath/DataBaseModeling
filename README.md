Model a Relational Database Schema using Sqlalchemy ORMs with ERP diagram

## What is this repo all about !?

While practicing the DataBase Modeling in python came across this framework [Database modeler](https://www.vertabelo.com/) 
they provided free version for small projects and we can export the XML files from ERP diagram, Using this XML files we can generate a
Sqlalchemy DataBase Models ,Later we can create engine and create the respective schemas in Database of our choice

I really enjoyed Creating my first ERP diagram, Reading what it is all about, How to construct one etc.Needs more practise 
and theoratical Knowledge to construct a complex schemas in RDBMS.
